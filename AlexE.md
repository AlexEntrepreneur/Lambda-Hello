1. Hello World! I'm Alex or Alexander, preferably Alex.

2. Three words to describe me would be short, chatty, and boring.

3. I love to party, and meet up with old friends from high school.

Favourite animal? A snake because I am one.

Another favourite would be listening to really bad music and playing it loudly to annoy my neighbours.

# THIS IS ALL TRUE I SWEAR
